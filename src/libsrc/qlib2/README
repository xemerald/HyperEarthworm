1.  The Makefile has now been modified to build 32-bit libraries into 
to subdirectory lib, and 64-bit libraries into the subdirectory lib64.
The filenames of the 64-bit libraries no longer contain a "64" in them.

lib:
libqlib2.a  libqlib2.debug.a  libqlib2nl.a  libqlib2nl.debug.a

lib64:
libqlib2.a  libqlib2.debug.a  libqlib2nl.a  libqlib2nl.debug.a

If you link programs from this source directory, the Makefile in
for these programs may need to be modified to look for the libraries
in the subdir lib or lib64.

2.  The Makefile now have a configurable section.  Look at it and modify it
appropriately.  

a.  Select where you want the library(s) to be installed.

b.  LEAPSECONDS defines where the leapseconds file will be installed (if you
run make install), and is also used when compiling the code to override the
default location of the leapsecond file defined in qtime2.c.

c.  If you want only 32-bit or 64-bit libraries, change the definition of
the "all" target to include only all32 or all64.  On Linux, if you have
a 32-bit compiler, you CANNOT build a 64-bit library.
